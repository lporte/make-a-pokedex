## Learning Competencies
- consume an API 
- implement an HTTP GET request
- retrieve data from a JSON response

Install the dependencies & start the server
```bash
$ npm install

$ node server.js
```

View the Pokedex in your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Getting Started
1.  Check out the (Pokeapi documentation)[http://pokeapi.co/docsv2/#] 
    - Read about what the API does and the shape of the data returned.
2.  Try making a GET request in curl or your browser
3.  Navigate to the JSON-Challenge branch and follow the instructions in the README
4.  Navigate to the GET-Challenge branch and follow the instructions in the README
5.  Finished?  Try out the stretch challenges below!  Decide how to adapt the API to fit your current needs.

## Question time
What information can you get out of the API? How can you manipulate it? What are this APIs limitations?

## Stretch Challenges: 

Now that you have a fully functional GET request working, you have the perfect project on which to experiment. 

Implement any of the following:
  - **Customize the front end.** Can you catch em all?  Animate the Pokemon avatars?  Refactor the styling to a team Mystic theme?
  - **Add Additional Routes and Views** Add a splash page with a welcome message
  - **Use an endpoint that requires authentication**. Implement the 
      [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) to post to your account every time you like a pokemon in your pokedex
